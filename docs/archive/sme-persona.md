# SME Persona — AFAQ ESG

## Demographics
- **Role:** General Manager / Operations Director
- **Company type:** Small trading/manufacturing company (50-200 employees), UAE-based, unlisted
- **Market:** UAE (Dubai/Sharjah), subject to indirect ESG pressure from banks and large buyers
- **Experience level:** 10+ years in operations, zero formal ESG training, basic Excel skills

## Context
- **Why they're looking:** Received procurement questionnaire from a major buyer (e.g., ADNOC, Emirates, Emaar) asking for ESG policies, carbon data, and governance proof. Deadline: 2-4 weeks. Failure to respond means losing the contract.
- **Budget:** AED 5,000-15,000 discretionary (can approve myself), beyond that needs owner/board sign-off. Comparing against hiring a consultant (AED 25k-50k+, 8-12 weeks minimum).
- **Time pressure:** High — questionnaire due in 2-4 weeks, can't wait months for consultant deliverables.
- **Current solution:** Manual Word docs + Google, maybe hired an intern to search for templates. No structured ESG process. No one on staff understands GRI, TCFD, or IFRS S1/S2.

## Psychology
- **Trust triggers:** 
  - References to UAE-specific regulations
  - Bilingual (English/Arabic) capability
  - Examples from similar UAE companies (not Western case studies)
  - Transparency about what data is missing vs fabricated
  - Evidence register (audit-proof)
  
- **Objections:**
  1. "This looks like a Western enterprise tool — it won't understand our situation"
  2. "I don't have the data it's asking for — will it make up fake numbers?"
  3. "Even if I get a report, our buyer will hire a consultant to verify it and we'll be exposed"
  
- **Decision process:** Solo buyer for < AED 15k. Above that, needs owner approval (may take 1-2 weeks).

- **Industry vocabulary:** Supply chain compliance, tender requirements, bank due diligence, scope 1/2/3 (vaguely), materiality assessment, procurement pack, supplier onboarding

## Success Criteria
- **What "done" looks like:** A completed questionnaire response with proper framework references, evidence trail showing what we have vs don't have, and a board-ready PDF that won't embarrass us if audited.
- **Willingness to pay:** AED 1,500-5,000 for a rapid pack (72h delivery). Up to AED 15,000 for comprehensive report + ongoing support.
- **Deal breaker:** If the tool fabricates data or makes claims we can't back up with evidence. We'd rather admit gaps than lie to a major customer.

## Trigger Event (Current Situation)
Just received email from procurement team at [Major GCC Buyer]:

> "As part of our supplier ESG assessment program, please complete the attached questionnaire and provide evidence of your sustainability policies, carbon footprint data (Scope 1-2 minimum), and governance framework. Responses due by [Date: 21 days from now]."

Attachment is 47 questions covering:
- Environmental management system
- GHG emissions data + calculation methodology
- Waste management + circular economy practices
- Labor policies + health & safety
- Anti-corruption + ethics policies
- Board oversight of ESG risks

**Internal panic:** We have none of this documented. Owner wants to know if we can do it ourselves or if we need to hire someone.
