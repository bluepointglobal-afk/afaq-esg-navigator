# SME Evaluation — AFAQ ESG
**Date:** 2026-02-03  
**Persona:** General Manager, Al Noor Trading LLC (150 employees, UAE manufacturing/trading)

## Verdict: WOULD EXPLORE MORE (but not ready to pay yet)

I just got a procurement questionnaire from one of our major buyers with 2 weeks to respond. I don't have time for a consultant (8+ weeks, AED 40k+), so I'm looking for something fast.

## Money Path Walkthrough (First Person)

**Landing at http://localhost:5000:**

The app loaded. I see... wait, what is this? There's no clear landing page, no "What is AFAQ" headline. It looks like I landed directly inside a dashboard or tool interface. 

**Immediate concern:** Is this the product or did I land on a broken page? Where's the value proposition? I expected to see something like "72-Hour ESG Compliance Pack for UAE SMEs" but I'm just staring at what looks like an empty form or dashboard.

**Would I continue?** Maybe for 30 more seconds, but this already feels confusing.

## Trust Killers

1. **No clear value proposition on entry** — I don't know what this does, who it's for, or why I should trust it. If I sent this URL to my owner, he'd ask "What am I looking at?"

2. **No UAE/GCC branding or language cues** — Nothing tells me this understands UAE regulations, Tadawul, ADX, or local procurement requirements. Could be any generic Western tool.

3. **No social proof** — No logos of UAE companies using this, no "Trusted by 50+ GCC SMEs" badge, no consultant endorsements.

4. **No evidence of audit-worthiness** — I need to know upfront that this won't fabricate data. The lack of "Evidence Register" or "Audit Trail" messaging makes me nervous.

---

## Value Gaps

1. **Missing trigger-based messaging** — I came here because of a procurement deadline. Where's the "Got a supplier ESG questionnaire? Get your response pack in 72 hours" hook?

2. **No sample output shown** — I can't see what I'll actually receive. Show me a redacted sample report from a UAE company so I know the quality.

3. **No bilingual capability visible** — Many of our stakeholders prefer Arabic. If this can't handle Arabic output, it's not suitable.

4. **No pricing upfront** — I have AED 5k discretionary budget. If this costs more, I need to know now before I waste time.

## Buy Triggers

1. **Show me the 72h pack sample** — A real procurement response pack (10-15 pages) with evidence register. If it looks professional and audit-ready, I'd pay today.

2. **"Used by [UAE Company Names]" or regulator endorsement** — Even one recognizable UAE company would massively increase trust.

3. **Clear "AED 1,499 — Get Started Now" button** — Remove friction. I can approve this amount myself.

4. **Guarantee: "No fabricated data — we show gaps clearly"** — This is my biggest fear. Make this promise prominent.

## Pricing Assessment

**Perceived value vs stated price:** Can't assess — no price shown, no value demonstrated yet.

**Would I expense or need approval?** Under AED 5k I can approve myself. Above that needs owner sign-off (adds 1-2 weeks delay).

**Alternative cost:** Hiring consultant = AED 25-50k + 8-12 weeks. If AFAQ delivers in 72h for under AED 5k, it's a no-brainer... but I need to SEE proof it works.

## Competitive Position

**What I'd compare this to:**
- Hiring a local ESG consultant (slow, expensive, but trusted)
- DIY with templates (free but risky — might miss requirements)
- Ignore it and risk losing the contract (unacceptable)

**What AFAQ does better (potentially):**
- Speed (72h vs 8 weeks)
- Cost (if under AED 5k)
- Self-service (no consultant meetings)

**What it does worse right now:**
- Trust (consultant has reputation, this is unknown)
- Clarity (I don't understand what I'm buying yet)

## Top 3 Changes to Close This Persona

1. **Landing page with trigger-based headline** — "Supplier ESG Questionnaire Due in 2 Weeks? Get Your Response Pack in 72 Hours" + show the AED 1,499 price + UAE company logos + sample pack preview. This would move me from "confused" to "interested" instantly.

2. **Embedded sample output** — A viewable/downloadable 10-page sample report with evidence register from a fictional UAE company. Let me see exactly what I'll receive before I pay. This addresses the trust gap.

3. **Simplified onboarding promise** — "15-minute questionnaire → We build your pack → 72h delivery → Audit-ready evidence included." Show me the process is fast and guided, not another complex enterprise tool that needs training.

**Revenue Impact:** These three changes would move me from "WOULD EXPLORE MORE" to "WOULD PAY TODAY" because they address my core blockers: trust (sample + social proof), urgency (72h promise), and budget clarity (AED 1,499 visible price).
